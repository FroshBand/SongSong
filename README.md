Frosh Band's First Song
Written in Fall of 2017

## Lyrics
# Verse 1:
Bigger than a mountain troll 
As bad as they can get
And maybe I can't fly today
Cause that ain't happened yet

For now it's just me
The road beneath my feet
They'll never take me down
Cause I'll just get back up again

#Prechorus:
My boots step seven leagues
My falcon follows me
I'm ready for this fight
Is it you or me tonight?

# Chorus: 
Searching for adventure here
Putting straight an orc or two
Earning all my stripes and glory
Collecting on my debts 

Here my name is hellhounds' bane 
My legacy goes on and on 
Maybe I'll go home one day
But I'm not done here yet

# Verse 2:
Smarter than a dragon
As clever as they get
And maybe I'm not king today 
Cause that ain't happened yet

For now it's just me
The road beneath my feet
They'll never take me down
Cause I'll just get back up again

# Prechorus:
My boots step seven leagues
My falcon follows me
I'm ready for this fight
Is it you or me tonight?

# Chorus:
Searching for adventure here
Putting straight an orc or two
Earning all my stripes and glory
Collecting on my debts 

Here my name is hellhounds bane 
My legacy goes on and on 
Maybe I'll go home one day
But I'm not done here yet

# Solo xmany:
don't sing. why are you singing?

# Prechorus Alt: 
My armor's made of steel
My sword will make kings yield
I'm ready for this fight
Is it you or me tonight?

# Chorus Half:
Searching for adventure here
Putting straight an orc or two
Earning all my stripes and glory
Collecting on my debts 

Here my name is hellhounds bane 
My legacy goes on and on 
Maybe I'll go home one day
But I'm not done here yet

# Chorus Breakdown:
I've saved your village countless times
Eagles call me one of them
Ogres quake to hear my steps
As all the goblins run 

Bards proclaim my name abroad
I hear it echo in the hills
Maybe I'll go home one day
But I'm not done here yet
